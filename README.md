## Build process

This library uses Gulp to perform the build task.

This task can be performed calling the task 'build' defined in the gulpfile.js of the project:

```
node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js build
```

## Running tests

Tests can be run using the run task defined in the gulpfile of the project:

```
node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js test
```

This library uses puppeteer to run tests and istambul.js to generate a coverage report. The report will be generated at the coverage folder of the project.
